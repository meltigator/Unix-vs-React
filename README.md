🚀 React in 1 Minute? Yes, Thanks to Unix & MSYS2!

Just built a zero-config React demo entirely with Bash + Unix tools on Windows (via MSYS2)! 🧠
Why it’s cool:

✅ No npm/Node.js/Webpack – React loaded directly from CDN
✅ Bash script automates everything: HTML, CSS, JSX, and even a README
✅ 100% portable – Runs with a simple python -m http.server
✅ Proof that Unix philosophy ("do one thing well") still rocks in 2025!

👉 Want to see the magic? Here’s how to run it:

# bash
bash unix_vs_react.sh  
# Then open http://localhost:8000 🎉  

Key takeaway: Sometimes, "old-school" tools like Bash and Unix utilities can deliver modern results with minimal overhead. Perfect for quick prototypes, demos, or even interview challenges!

Shoutout to MSYS2 for bringing Unix power to Windows devs! 🐧💻
